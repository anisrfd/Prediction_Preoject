Created data frame with necessary features.
Then labeled the dataset by whom the output is dependable.
Converted data frame into scalar form. 
Then trained the test and train datset and the test data is 0.20 of actual data.
Apllied KNN Classiﬁer and predicted outcome by using confusion matrix.Calculated the accuracy of the results. 
Take an input from the customer. Predicted the outcome by corelating the attributes and confusion matrix.
Then calculated the mean error rate.
